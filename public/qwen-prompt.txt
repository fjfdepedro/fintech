Title: Peter Brandt Dismisses Bitcoin Price Reversal Yet: Here is What to Watch Out for Ahead
Source: coinpedia
Date: 15/4/2025
Summary: The post Peter Brandt Dismisses Bitcoin Price Reversal Yet: Here is What to Watch Out for Ahead appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Brandt believes that Bitcoin price is not yet out of the woods unless it consistently closes above $88k. The bullish sentiment from the United States has coincided with increased whale accumulation amid anticipated diplomatic solutions for the ongoing tariff trade wars. Bitcoin (BTC) price teased above $86k for the first time, on Tuesday during the mid-New York session, since President Donald Trump announced the reciprocal tariffs earlier this month. The flagship coin reached a daily high of about $86,429 before retracing SFP around $85.6 at the time of this writing. The meeting of U.S. President Donald Trump and El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele sparked bullish sentiment for the wider crypto market. Moreover, the Trump administration is actively seeking ways to fund its strategic Bitcoin reserves, with some speculating funding from tariffs. Bitcoin Price Regains Whale’s Confidence As Gold price continues to signal market strength amid declining Volatility S&P 500 Index (VIX), the Bitcoin adoption by whale investors has gained more traction. According to market data from Glassnode, the number of Bitcoin addresses holding between 1K–10K coins has risen from 1,944 on March 5 to 2,014 at the time of this writing. The last time Bitcoin whales accumulated to this level was in April 2024, which resulted in a major bullish uproar in the subsequent weeks. Expert’s Insights and Analysis For the first time since January 2025, Bitcoin price, against the U.S. dollar, invalidated the daily logarithmic falling trend. As a result, the wider crypto market has experienced bullish sentiment, led by Solana (SOL) and Ripple Labs XRP. However, Peter Brandt, a veteran trader, has dismissed Bitcoin price reversal yet. “A trendline violation does NOT signify a transition of trend $BTC. Sorry,” Brandt noted . According to Brandt, Bitcoin price has to consistently close above $88k to confirm a successful reversal of the year-to-date market correction. Meanwhile, Brandt remains a proponent of combining bullish reversal patterns – including double bottom, inverse head and shoulders – with trendlines to predict the market.

Title: Man Faces Six Years in Prison After Omitting $12,302,115 in CryptoPunk NFT Sales From Tax Filing
Source: The Daily Hodl
Date: 15/4/2025
Summary: A Pennsylvania man could serve up to six years in prison after filing false tax returns that underreported millions of dollars of income he made from selling non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Waylon Wilcox earned most of his unreported money by hawking 97 CryptoPunk NFTs in 2021 and 2022, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. The U.S. Attorney says Wilcox underreported his 2021 income by more than $8.5 million and reduced his tax burden by nearly $2.2 million. He then underreported his 2022 income by nearly $4.6 million and reduced his tax by more than $1 million. Both years, he indicated on his tax returns that he didn’t receive money for digital assets, but prosecutors say that he sold 97 CryptoPunks worth $12.3 million. Explained Yury Kruty, Philadelphia Field Office Special Agent in Charge, “IRS Criminal Investigation is committed to unraveling complex financial schemes involving virtual currencies and non-fungible token (NFT) transactions designed to conceal taxable income. In today’s economic environment, it’s more important than ever that the American people feel confident that everyone is playing by the rules and paying the taxes they owe.” Wilcox pled guilty last week to two counts related to filing false tax returns. He will be sentenced at a later date and faces a maximum penalty of six years in prison.

Title: Key US dollar data hits 2006 levels: will this boost Bitcoin and altcoins?
Source: crypto.news
Date: 15/4/2025
Summary: The U.S. dollar index remains under pressure as Donald Trump’s tariffs push investors to other currencies. The DXY index was trading at $99.95 on Tuesday, down by 9.20% from its highest level this year. It has also been hovering at its lowest point since July 2023, and a death cross it formed points to more downside in the coming months. The US dollar index could crash further More technical signals show that the U.S. dollar index has further downside potential. It has formed an inverse cup and shoulders pattern whose depth is about 9%. Measuring the same distance from the lower side of the cup points to further downside to $91. US dollar index chart | Source: TradingView Further, a key survey of institutional investors shows that most of them are bearish on the currency as the trade war continues. Sixty-one percent of respondents in Bank of America’s Global Fund Manager Survey see the greenback falling in the next 12 months. This is the most bearish these fund managers have been since 2006. These investors are concerned about Trump’s policies and their economic impact. The most urgent fear is tariffs, which analysts expect will affect the economy. Many fund managers believe the U.S. will sink into a recession this year. While Trump has walked back some tariffs, those on China remain at uncomfortable levels. Most Chinese goods flowing to the United States will receive a 145% tariff, affecting goods worth hundreds of billions of dollars. On Tuesday, Beijing announced that it would block Boeing purchases by its airlines. Further, the U.S. dollar index has dropped as Congress negotiates Trump’s funding bill, which includes $4.5 trillion in tax cuts.

First, most of these coins are traded in Tether, a stablecoin backed by the U.S. dollar. As such, a weakening greenback makes Bitcoin and these altcoins more affordable. Second, the ongoing dollar weakness is likely due to concerns about the American economy and the impact of tariffs. As such, there is a likelihood that the Federal Reserve will intervene and slash interest rates. Some Fed officials, like Christopher Waller and Susan Collins, have confirmed that the bank is ready to act in the event of a recession.
