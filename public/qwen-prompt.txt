It’s often implemented to improve performance, enhance security, or introduce new features. In this case, Scroll, the network associated with the SCR token, is undergoing a major upgrade to its main network. To ensure a smooth and secure transition during this upgrade, crypto exchanges like Upbit often temporarily suspend certain token activities.

Title: VanEck Executive Unveils Massive Bitcoin Price Target, Sees BTC Rising 423% in Just Two Years
Source: The Daily Hodl
Date: 16/4/2025
Summary: An analyst at a prominent global investment firm thinks Bitcoin ( BTC ) could surge to $180,000 in the second half of 2025. Matthew Sigel, the head of digital assets research at VanEck, says in a new interview with David Lin that his target is based on an analysis of previous BTC cycles. Sigel cautions, however, that Bitcoin will need to get through the current “macro-driven” period of uncertainty to reach that $180,000 level. He says he’s been encouraged by the spike in interest he’s seen in Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) from traditional asset managers. “My inbound phone calls are up like 300% from investment advisers who were afraid to allocate to Bitcoin ETFs and now with the election and the change in administration, they’re much more open to discussing the investment case for Bitcoin.” The research analyst also shares his 2026/2027 outlook for the top crypto asset. “For those advisers taking a longer-term perspective, we benchmark Bitcoin against gold, specifically the 50% of the gold market that is more speculative in nature. So about half of gold goes into jewelry or industrial use cases, but putting that aside, if Bitcoin can reach the 50% of gold that’s speculative in nature, that would imply roughly $450,000 per coin.” BTC is trading at $83,900 at time of writing.

Summary: VICTORIA, Seychelles, April 16, 2025 /PRNewswire/ BiyaPay , a global multi-asset trading wallet, has announced the launch of new platform capabilities designed to simplify access to both cryptocurrency and traditional financial services. In response to widespread challenges slowing user growth in the crypto sector, BiyaPay’s latest updates focus on reducing entry barriers, enhancing compliance, and offering a unified experience across digital and traditional asset classes. Market Context: Barriers Hindering New User Adoption The digital asset sector, once defined by surging user growth during cycles of innovation like NFTs and metaverse tokens, is now experiencing stagnation. Analysts attribute this to operational complexity, fragmented platforms, inconsistent global regulations, and ongoing security concerns. New users often face steep technical and procedural barriers—including complex wallet setups, asset incompatibility across blockchains, and opaque onboarding steps—contributing to attrition before users can fully engage with the ecosystem. BiyaPay’s Integrated Solution to Industry Challenges In response, BiyaPay has positioned itself as a bridge between traditional and crypto finance by offering a unified multi-asset wallet that addresses these concerns: One-Stop Financial Management: The platform combines digital assets, U.S. and Hong Kong equities, and fiat transactions within a single application. This eliminates the need for users to manage multiple accounts across different services and sectors. Global Remittance and Real-Time Exchange: BiyaPay supports the instant conversion of over 30 fiat currencies alongside 200+ digital assets. Its international remittance service features transaction fees as low as 0.5%, offering a competitive alternative to traditional cross-border payment systems. Compliance and Security: Operating with financial licenses in jurisdictions such as Singapore, the U.S., Canada, and Hong Kong, BiyaPay employs bank-grade encryption and multi-layered identity verification to mitigate user risk and build trust. Dual-Flow Investment Channels: Catering to both crypto traders and traditional investors, BiyaPay supports asset conversion across crypto and equity markets, enabling diversified portfolio management through a single interface. Future Roadmap and Web3 Expansion Looking forward, BiyaPay plans to enhance its offerings with additional Web3-focused services.
