Title: Neptune Digital Assets grows Bitcoin treasury to 401 BTC
Source: crypto.news
Date: 10/4/2025
Summary: Neptune Digital Assets Corp. has expanded its Bitcoin treasury to 401 BTC as of April 10, 2025. The Vancouver-based firm claims it still has its Bitcoin ( BTC ) at an average price of $31,564—significantly below the 2024 average of $65,901 and the $67,458 average paid by institutional players like Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy). The move builds on Neptune’s earlier purchase of 20 BTC and 1 million Dogecoin ( DOGE ) between late December and early February, bringing its total Bitcoin holdings from 376 to 401 BTC. Neptune’s disciplined, cost-efficient strategy has helped it outperform many corporate treasuries in terms of acquisition cost, bolstering its position amid fluctuating market conditions.

Our growing treasury reflects our confidence in Bitcoin’s future and Neptune’s disciplined approach to strategic asset allocation,” said Moodie. This includes dollar-cost averaging, opportunistic buying, mining operations, interest-generating derivatives, and converting staking rewards into Bitcoin. Neptune, one of Canada’s first publicly traded blockchain companies, operates across multiple areas of the crypto ecosystem — from proof-of-work and proof-of-stake mining to DeFi and blockchain infrastructure. The company stated it will continue to optimize its treasury management while seeking value-driven expansion in the broader digital asset landscape.

Source: The Daily Hodl
Date: 10/4/2025
Summary: The official corporate arm of the Dogecoin Foundation is partnering with one of the world’s leading producers of crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) on a new Dogecoin ( DOGE ) product. In a new press release , 21Shares and House of Doge are announcing their new partnership to launch DOGE ETPs globally. Says Jens Wiechers, Advisory Board Member at House of Doge and Co-Executive Director of the Dogecoin Foundation, of the new partnership, “This partnership marks a very large step forward for the Dogecoin vision. Dogecoin was created to be a fun, accessible form of peer-to-peer money, and over the years, it has demonstrated real-world utility in payments, tipping, and charitable giving. For Dogecoin to reach its full potential as a global currency, institutional support and corporate partnerships are essential. This initiative with 21Shares provides a regulated path for institutions to participate in and amplify the ‘Dogecoin is Money’ vision, while still honoring the community’s spirit. Global adoption is critical, and we’re excited to take this next step – ensuring Dogecoin stays fun, but gains the credibility and backing needed to thrive at scale.” Dogecoin is the original memecoin, and 21Shares boasts over $7 billion in assets under management across 11 major exchanges. Says Duncan Moir, President at 21Shares, of the powerhouse crypto partnership, “Registered investment vehicles are essential for broadening access to digital assets, and Dogecoin’s growing adoption underscores its significance in the crypto ecosystem. By partnering with the House of Doge, we are taking a pivotal step in bringing transparent and institutional-grade investment options to the market. This move reflects our commitment to expanding investor access to innovative and community-driven assets while maintaining the highest regulatory and operational standards.” DOGE is trading for $0.150 at time of writing, up 1.7% in the last 24 hours.

Title: TRON amasses $900 million in fees in just 4 months
Source: Finbold
Date: 10/4/2025
Summary: As the broader crypto market battles volatility driven by escalating trade tensions, TRON ( TRX ) is experiencing record network demand. Governed by TRON DAO, the blockchain has generated over $900 million in fees year-to-date, according to TokenTerminal —a clear sign of rising network activity. At press time, TRX is trading at $0.2362, marking a 0.78% gain for the day. With a market capitalization of $22.43 billion, TRON continues to hold its position as the ninth-largest cryptocurrency by overall market value. TRX one-day price chart. Source: Finbold TRON sees a surge in stablecoin activity This fee milestone comes as TRON experiences a notable surge in on-chain usage. According to Lookonchain , the combined value of USDT and USDC stablecoins on TRON grew by $396 million in the seven days leading up to April 7. In the past 7 days, stablecoins(USDT&USDC) on #Tron increased by $396M, and stablecoins(USDT&USDC) on #Berachain decreased by $269.56M. https://t.co/yr8wn96ApU pic.twitter.com/y8UY8piIqJ — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) April 7, 2025 TRON is also dominating in terms of exchange activity. In the same week, the network facilitated over $1.2 billion in Tether (USDT) inflows to crypto exchanges, further underlining its central role in stablecoin transfers. Moreover, the stablecoin value on the TRON blockchain has been steadily rising since early January. According to DeFiLlama , TRON’s total stablecoin market capitalization now stands at $67.27 billion. This consistent growth points to a bullish outlook, as rising stablecoin activity not only enhances on-chain utility but also contributes to the USDD burn mechanism, potentially drawing more users to the ecosystem. It also ranks as one of the most actively used networks, with over 2.5 million active addresses, second only to Solana ( SOL ). This combination of massive stablecoin usage, high wallet activity, and dominance in exchange flows is the likely catalyst behind TRON’s impressive fee growth. Although individual transaction fees on TRON remain low, the sheer transaction volume has generated consistent and significant protocol revenue, leading to the $900 million milestone in just four months.
